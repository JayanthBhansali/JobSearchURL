Dear Seurat Technologies Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Science Intern position for Summer 2025, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the ad - e.g., company website, LinkedIn].  Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Maryland, with an expected graduation date of May 2026, I possess a solid foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and Python programming, aligning perfectly with the requirements outlined in the job description. My coursework in Principles of Data Science, Principles of Machine Learning, and Big Data Systems has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of statistical modeling, algorithm development, and handling large datasets.  Furthermore, my project experience, including "Stream Your Mood," where I implemented facial expression recognition using TensorFlow and CNNs, showcases my practical application of these skills.

My professional experience as a Business Intelligence Developer at Infosys Limited further solidified my data analysis capabilities.  I designed and deployed Qlik Sense dashboards for a global shipping company, automating performance tracking and analysis, resulting in significant time savings.  This role honed my SQL skills and experience with ETL processes, optimizing data models and queries for improved performance.  Additionally, my experience presenting dashboard functionalities to stakeholders has cultivated my communication and presentation skills, enabling me to effectively convey complex data insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I am confident that my academic background, project experience, and professional achievements demonstrate my ability to contribute meaningfully to your team.  My passion for data science, coupled with my proven ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges, makes me an ideal candidate for this internship. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills can benefit Seurat Technologies. Thank you for your time and consideration.
